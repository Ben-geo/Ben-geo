## **About Me**
I’m an Applied Machine Learning Engineer focused on building **scalable, high-performance ML systems and data platforms**.  
My work spans **reinforcement learning**, **LLM-based tools**, and **large-scale data engineering**, with a focus on **research-driven engineering**, system optimization, and production reliability.

I enjoy projects that combine creative problem-solving with disciplined engineering — especially those that transform complex ideas into real, measurable impact.
